# Magic Moose

Write a console application for a fortune telling moose. It's a more _enthusiastic_ version of [Magic 8 Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball)

## Phase 1

When the application starts, the Magic Moose should prompt the user to ask a question

## Phase 2

After the user asks the question, the Magic Moose should randomly reply with one of these responses.

1. As I see it, yes.
1. Ask again later.
1. Better not tell you now.
1. Cannot predict now.
1. Concentrate and ask again.
1. Don’t count on it.
1. It is certain.
1. It is decidedly so.
1. Most likely.
1. My reply is no.
1. My sources say no.
1. Outlook not so good.
1. Outlook good.
1. Reply hazy, try again.
1. Signs point to yes.
1. Very doubtful.
1. Without a doubt.
1. Yes.
1. Yes – definitely.
1. You may rely on it.

## Phase 3

Allow the user to continue to ask questions. If the user hits ENTER without asking a question, the program should exit
