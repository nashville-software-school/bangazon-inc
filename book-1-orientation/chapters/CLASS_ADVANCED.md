# More about Classes

So far we've learned a lot about the power of classes in C#. This includes most of what you'll use on a regular basis, but there are a few more features of classes that you need to understand.

**add something about generics**

## Static

The `static` keyword is used to make class methods and properties usable without creating an instance of the class.

```cs
public class StringUtils
{
    public static string MakeExciting(string source)
    {
        return $"{source}!!!";
    }

    public static string Capitalize(string source)
    {
        char first = source[0];
        char upperFirst = Char.ToUpper(first);
        string rest = source.Substring(1);
        return $"{upperFirst}{rest}";
    }
}

public class Printer
{
    public void PrintSomeStuff()
    {
        string name = "mae";
        string statement = "I like the smell of scentless candles";

        Console.WriteLine(StringUtils.Capitalize(name));
        Console.WriteLine(StringUtils.MakeExciting(statement));
    }
}
```

To reference a `static` method or property, prefix it with the name of the class as we did with the `StringUtils` class in the example above.

## Overriding Properties and Methods

When inheriting from a parent class it is sometimes useful to redefine one or more of the parent class's methods and/or properties.

```cs
// The parent (aka "base") class
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public virtual void Greet(Person otherPerson)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Hello, {otherPerson.Name}. It is a pleasure to meet you. I am {Name}");
    }
}

// The child (aka "sub") class
public class Stoner : Person
{
    public override void Greet(Person otherPerson)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Hey fellow human named {otherPerson.Name}. Meeting you is, like, an honor or whatever. They call me, {Name} the unusually awesome.");
    }
}
```

Note that we must mark the `Greet` method in both the parent and child classes. We use the `virtual` keyword in the parent class and the `override` keyword in the child class.

Probably the most famous use of overriding a method in C# is the `ToString()` method. This method is defined in the `System.Object` class and is used any time C# needs to convert an object into a string (for example, for printing with `Console.WriteLine()`). It is common for our custom classes to override `ToString()` in order to control how our objects are converted to strings.

```cs
public class SuperPower
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public double Intensity { get; set; }

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return $"Power {Name} with {Intensity}% intensity";
    }
}
```

## Overloading Methods

In C# we have the ability to create methods of the same name, just as long as they take different types, or different number of arguments. This feature is called _overloading_

```csharp
public class Greeter
{
    public void Greet(string name)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Hello, {name}! It's good to see you again");
    }

    public void Greet(Person person)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Hey there {person.Name}. Welcome back!");
    }

    public void Greet()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Welcome Back");
    }
}
```

Even though these three methods are all named the same thing, this code is perfectly valid because they take separate types as arguments. If somewhere else in our program we call `Greet` and pass it a `string`, the `Greet` method with the `string` parameter will be invoked

```csharp
Greeter g = new Greeter();
g.Greet("Bobby");

// Hello, Bobby! It's good to see you again
```

Likewise, if we were to instead to call `Greet` and pass in an instance of `Person`, we would be invoking the third method

```csharp
Greeter g = new Greeter();
Person sue = new Person { Name = "Susan" };
g.Greet(sue);

// Hey there Susan. Welcome back!
```

## Access Modifiers

We've already learned about the  `public` and `private` access modifiers. C# has a few more as well.

### Protected

Methods and properties that have tagged with the `protected` keyword prevent access from outside the class hierarchy (ie. the family); however, `protected` methods are usable from derived classes (i.e. children).

```cs
// Base class
public class Automobile {

    public string Break() {
        SqueezeBreakPads();
        return "skuuuuuur";
    }

    protected string SqueezeBreakPads() {
        return "";
    }
}

// Derived class
public class Car : Automobile {

    public string UseEmergencyBreak() {
        SqueezeBreakPads();
        return "skreeech!";
    }
}

// Usage Example in a Program.cs file somewhere
Car stella = new Car();

// UseEmergencyBreak method can use the protected SqueezeBreakPads from the Automobile class.
Console.WriteLine($"Applying the break: {stella.UseEmergencyBreak()}");
```

### Internal

Classes, methods and properties tagged with the `internal` keyword allow access from anywhere within the same compiled assembly (DLL or EXE).

### Protected Internal

`protected internal` is the only allowed combination of multiple access modifiers. A `protected internal` method or property is accessible from the current assembly or from classes that are derived from the containing class.
