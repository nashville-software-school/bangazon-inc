# Installing required software

## Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is Microsoft's cross-platform editor that we'll be using during orientation for writing C# and building .NET applications. Make sure you add the [C# extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/csharp) immediately after installation completes.

## Install .NET Core

1. Visit the [.NET Tutorial](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started-with-dotnet-tutorial) site, click on your OS and follow the steps to install .NET Core.
1. In your terminal go to your `workspace` directory and do steps 2 and 3 in the tutorial to verify everything works.
