# Using SQL in a .NET Application

This will be an interactive lesson. Your instructor will lead you through following the instructions.

## Instructions

1. Use the [departments and employees](./assets/departments-employees.sql) SQL script to create a `DepartmentsEmployees` database.
1. In Visual Studio, create a new console application called `DepartmentsEmployees`.
1. In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you created your project. The directory will have a `DepartmentsEmployees.sln` file in it.
1. `cd` into your project directory. When you list what's in the directory, you should see your `DepartmentsEmployees.csproj` and `Program.cs`.
1. Run the following commands. This imports the required package needed to have your C# code connect to a SQL Server database.
    ```sh
    dotnet add package System.Data.SqlClient
    dotnet restore
    ```
1. Create or update the `*.cs` files with the code found below.
1. Run the application, fix any compiler errors (if any).
1. In `Program.cs`, complete the `PrintDepartmentReport(string title, List<Department> departments)`.
1. Run the application, note the printed reports.
1. In `Program.cs`, complete the `PrintEmployeeReport(string title, List<Employee> employees)`.
1. Run the application, note the printed reports.
1. Review the methods in `Repository.cs`.
1. Complete the unfinished methods in `Repository.cs`. _Remember to test your work along the way!_

## C# files
