# Debugging in Visual Studio

## Starting in Debug Mode

Your instruction team will show you how to start your application is debug mode. You should also read the [Navigate Code with the Visual Studio Debugger](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/navigating-through-code-with-the-debugger?view=vs-2017) to read more about it.

## Breakpoints

Your instruction team will show you how to set breakpoints to pause the execution of your code on a particular line, but you can also read the [Use Breakpoints in the Visual Studio Debugger](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/using-breakpoints?view=vs-2017) article.

## Autos and Locals Window

When you are stopped on a breakpoint in Visual Studio, you can view either all variables in the current scope, or just the variables on the current and preceding lines.

These are displayed in the [Autos and Locals Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/autos-and-locals-windows?view=vs-2017).

## Immediate Window

The Immediate window is used to debug and evaluate expressions, execute statements, print variable values, and so forth. It allows you to enter expressions to be evaluated or executed by the development language during debugging.

Your instruction team will show you how to use this window, but you learn more by reading the [Immediate Window](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/immediate-window?view=vs-2017) article.

## Call Stack

## Exhausting List of Debugging Windows

There are more windows that you can use while debugging your application. To see the entire list, and read more about each one, read the [Learn about Debugger Windows in Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/debugger-windows?view=vs-2017) article.
