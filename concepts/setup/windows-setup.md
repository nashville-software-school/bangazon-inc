Depending on your installer, you'll take one of two routes at this point.  I'm pretty sure it will be route 1, but I'm leaving route 2 just in case.

### Route 1: Screen 9 (Your Account)                                

1. Create a user account.  It's possible you may be prompted to sign in with your Microsoft account instead.  If so, you might as well go for it, because you're going to have to sign up for (and in with) it eventually.
2. Click 'Finish'

### Route 2: Screen 9 (Sign-in to your Microsoft Account)

#### In you don't have a Microsost account                                      

1. Click the 'Create new Account' link on the bottom left.                      
2. Fill out any required info and progress through the prompts like normal.
