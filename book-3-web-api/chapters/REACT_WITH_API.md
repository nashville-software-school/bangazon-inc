# Adding a React Client

The cool thing about exposing a Web API is that any client capable of making HTTP requests can communicate with it. You can create web apps in React, Angular, or Vue and they could all talk to the same API. It even extends past browser based clients. You could make a mobile or desktop app and they could talk to the API. Maybe even IOT devices ([Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)) like microwaves or refrigerators want to make requests to your API.

## Create React App
 
Programming refrigerators may come in a later chapter. For now, lets build a react client that will make requests to our API. Open your Gifter project and make a directory called `client`. This is where we'll put our React code. In your terminal, `cd` into the client directory and run `npx create-react-app .`

**NOTE** VS Code has a much better developer experience when writing javascript. For our projects, it's recommended that you continue writing your C# code in Visual Studio, but use VS Code for javascript. `cd` into the newly created `client` folder and open VS Code from there using the `code .` command.

## Handling CORS

In development, our React app will be running on port 3000 and our API will be running on port 5001. Making requests from React to the Web API will result in CORS issues. We've seen one way we can resolve this--by enabling CORS on the server. Another way we can handle this is by adding a `proxy` property in our package.json file. Update the top of your package.json file to look like this:

```js
{
  "name": "client",
  "proxy": "https://localhost:5001",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  // ...other code omitted for brevity...
```

## Adding Post Provider

Make two directories under the `src` folder: `components` and `providers`. In the prodivers directory create a file called `PostProvider.js` and give it the following code

```js
import React, { useState } from "react";

export const PostContext = React.createContext();

export const PostProvider = (props) => {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);

  const getAllPosts = () => {
    return fetch("api/post")
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then(setPosts);
  };

  const addPost = (post) => {
    return fetch("api/post", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(post),
    });
  };

  return (
    <PostContext.Provider value={{ posts, getAllPosts, addPost }}>
      {props.children}
    </PostContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

This providers the state value of the posts array, as well as methods to fetch all posts and add a new post. Note that the urls we are making requests to are relative urls--they don't have anything like `https://localhost:5001/api/posts`. This is a benefit of adding the `proxy` attribute in our package.json file.

## Adding a Posts List Component

Inside the components directory, create a file called `PostList.js` and add the following code

```js
import React, { useContext, useEffect } from "react";
import { PostContext } from "../providers/PostProvider";

const PostList = () => {
  const { posts, getAllPosts } = useContext(PostContext);

  useEffect(() => {
    getAllPosts();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <div key={post.id}>
          <img src={post.imageUrl} alt={post.title} />
          <p>
            <strong>{post.title}</strong>
          </p>
          <p>{post.caption}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default PostList;
```

Nothing too fancy here. When the component loads, it will call the `getAllPosts` method it recieves from the provider and render a list of posts.

## Wiring It Up

We have our nice provider and component so lets use them. Replace App.js with the following code

```js
import React from "react";
import "./App.css";
import { PostProvider } from "./providers/PostProvider";
import PostList from "./components/PostList";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <PostProvider>
        <PostList />
      </PostProvider>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Make sure your API server is still running, and run `npm start` in your terminal.

## Styling w/ Reactstrap

Lets make our app look a little nicer. Install reactstrap by running the following command (Make sure to run this from the same directory your package.json file is in)

```sh
npm install --save bootstrap reactstrap
```

Now import the css file into your `index.js` file

```js
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
```

#### Making a Post Component

Our posts might get a little more complex so it's probably a good idea to separate it out into it's own component. Create a `Post.js` file in the components directory with the following code

```js
import React from "react";
import { Card, CardImg, CardBody } from "reactstrap";

const Post = ({ post }) => {
  return (
    <Card className="m-4">
      <p className="text-left px-2">Posted by: {post.userProfile.name}</p>
      <CardImg top src={post.imageUrl} alt={post.title} />
      <CardBody>
        <p>
          <strong>{post.title}</strong>
        </p>
        <p>{post.caption}</p>
      </CardBody>
    </Card>
  );
};

export default Post;
```

Again, nothing fancy here; we're just using the Card component that comes with reactstrap to organize some of the post details.

Now lets update the `PostList` component to use the new `Post` component

```js
import React, { useContext, useEffect } from "react";
import { PostContext } from "../providers/PostProvider";
import Post from "./Post";

const PostList = () => {
  const { posts, getAllPosts } = useContext(PostContext);

  useEffect(() => {
    getAllPosts();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="container">
      <div className="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="cards-column">
          {posts.map((post) => (
            <Post key={post.id} post={post} />
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default PostList;
```

## Exercise

1. Allow the user to add a new post. Create a `PostForm` component in the components directory and include it in App.js so that it shows up above the list of posts. Ex:

```js
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <PostProvider>
        {/* <AwesomeNewPostComponent/> */}
        <PostList />
      </PostProvider>
    </div>
  );
}
``` 

2. Put a button somewhere in the Post component that allows a user to delete a post.

3. Update the Post component so that it includes the comments on each post
