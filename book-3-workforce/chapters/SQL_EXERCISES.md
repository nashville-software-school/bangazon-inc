# SQL Exercises

As you know SQL is a _very_ important skill for a professional software developer to master. Frankly, you just can't get enough practice...so here's some more!

Please go through the [SQL exercises on w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/SQl/exercise.asp).

Below the links to each exercise question (on the left side of the page) you'll find a link to a tutorial related to the questions. If you are unclear about something, click that link and view the tutorial.

> **NOTE:** In some of the tutorials you wll find slightly different information depending on the database. Unfortunately, this is the nature of relational database management systems (RDBMS). For the purposes of this course, you should focus on SQL Server.

> **NOTE:** Don't just race through these exercises. Make sure you understand the answer before moving on.
