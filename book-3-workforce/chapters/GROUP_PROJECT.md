# Bangazon Workforce Management Site

Your team is reponsible for building an internal application for our human resources and IT departments. The application will allow them to create, list, and view Employees, Training Programs, Departments, and Computers.

You will be building an ASP<span>.NET</span> MVC Web Application using Visual Studio on Windows, using SQL Server as the database engine. You will be learning the Razor templating syntax. You will be learning how to use view models for defining the data to be used in a Razor template.

## Setup

Follow the general procedure from your previous sprint by having one team member create the initial project in Visual Studio and push it to github. Remember to setup the connection string in the `appsettings.json` file

This project will use the same [Bangazon database structure](../book-2-platform-api/chapters/sql/bangazon.sql) as the previous project, however, it is recommended that you make a new database in SQL Server, `BangazonWorkforce`, to help ensure you and your new teammates are working with the same data.
