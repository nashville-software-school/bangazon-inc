# The Backend

_You made it_

As you know by now, at NSS we focus on pragmatic, hands-on learning. To that end, we're going to spend most of our time focused on building a powerful, easy-to-use, multi-user blogging platform called _Tabloid<sup>TM</sup>_\*.

> <span>\*</span> _Tabloid_ is a wholly owned subsidiary of _Bangazon Inc._

## Orientation

We'll spend the first few weeks orienting you to .NET, C#, SQL, and a new set of tools and techniques for building complex applications.

1. Installation of required tools.
1. Introduction to the C# language.
1. Concepts of sustainable, scalable, object-oriented software development.
1. Overview of server-side development ecosystem
1. How the Internet works
1. Inheritance, composition, and aggregation
1. Entity relationships
1. Structured Query Language (SQL)

At the end of orientation, you will build a command line prototype of the _Tabloid_ application.

## Web Applications using Server-side Rendering

After orientation's focus on the command line development, we'll turn to web applications using Microsoft's powerful, open source [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/) framework.

We'll start with building server-side rendered web apps using [ASP.NET Core MVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview). These applications will generate HTML on the server and send it to the browser.

We'll wrap up this phase of the course by building an [MVP](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mvp/) of _Tabloid_.

## Full Stack Web Applications

Finally, we'll end the course by learning to build a back-end API using [ASP.NET Core Web API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/). This will give us the opportunity to build a dynamic front-end in React.

In the final group project we'll take two sprints to build _Tabloid_ as a full stack application with a .NET back-end and a React front-end.

## Capstone

After we've covered the course material, you'll wrap up your time at NSS by building a capstone project to demonstrate your learning.

## Learning Objectives

## What's in a name? 

> _That which we call .NET by any other name would code as sweet._

We begin our .NET journey with a warning: _Microsoft is bad at naming things._

In your online research you will find references to technologies called **".NET 5", "dotnet", ".NET Core", ".NET Framework"** and just plain old **".NET"**.

Once you get some experience under your belt this will all make (_a little_) more sense, but for now here's all you need to know...

* **.NET 5** is the latest version of .NET, and _**It is what we will use in this course**_.
* **dotnet** is the command line tool we'll use during the first part of the course. It will target .NET 5 without us having to do anything special.
* **.NET Core** is the _previous version_ of .NET, but it is not very old. If you find documentation, blog posts, Stack Overflow answers, etc... referring to .NET Core, most of the time _**the information will still be accurate and you should use it**_. However, you should pay attention to the _version number_ of .NET Core. Information about versions `2.x` or `3.x` is much better than `1.x`.
* **.NET Framework** is the old, Windows-only version of .NET. It was replaced by .NET Core and then by .NET 5. Even though it's old, it is still used _a lot_, so you'll probably find references to it on the web. _**We will NOT be using .NET Framework in this corse. When you find information that refers to .NET Framework, you should IGNORE IT**_.
* **.NET** is an umbrella term that might refer to _**ANY**_ of the above technologies. Microsoft is _trying_ to re-brand .NET to refer to .NET 5, but that hasn't happened (yet?). When you run into this term you should try to figure out which .NET is refers to. If you can't, ask for help or move on to another resource.
 
In addition to the above terms, you might find online references to **"mono", "xamarin" or "unity"**. These are still current technologies that are related to .NET, but they won't be covered in this corse.
