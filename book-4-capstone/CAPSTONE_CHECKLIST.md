# Checklist for setting up a Fullstack Capstone

This checklist covers creating a project with ASP<span>.</span>NET Core Web API, SQL Server, React and Firebase Auth.

The technologies outlines in this chapter are _NOT_ the only technologies you are allowed to use for your capstone, but they are the standard, "happy-path" technologies that we generally recommend.

_**If you would like to use an alternative technology (ex. MVC, etc...) you must get approval from your capstone mentor.**_

Most of these steps will require copying code from Tabloid and Gifter, so you may want to have those repositories handy before you start

You can view a video walk-through of these steps [here](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/Bgnm4gt_tnzLDqYjurEu6fNlNFKR1JvUIv6MJPzV3pUn5O7SorCKThA7oZSOENH5.CPfq3-FjcpbbHSvt) Passcode is %wmVL*5@

## Set up project

1. Create Web API project in Visual Studio
1. Create .gitignore
1. Run `git init` from the root of your project

## Setup SQL Server
1. Create a `SQL` folder in the root of your project
1. Add a SQL script called `01_Db_Create.sql` that creates your database (start by either copying and modifying the Gifter script or generate one from DBDiagram)
1. (Optional) Add a SQL script called  `02_Seed_Data.sql` to insert seed data records into your database tables. **Note** You could also add the seed data in the first script if you prefer
1. Run the script(s) to create and seed your database.

> **NOTE:** The script(s) should be written such that they can be re-run as needed to recreate your database. _See the Gifter script for an example_


## Set up Firebase

1. Go to Firebase console and create a new project
1. Enable a "Sign-in method"
    > **NOTE:** In the course we used the `Email/Password` sign-in method.
1. Go to project settings to view API Key and Project ID (you'll need these in future steps)

## Server Side

1. Install Nuget Packages (Copy from Tabloid.csproj and/or Gifter.csproj)
1. Add connection string to `appsettings.json`
1. Create Models
1. Update `appsettings.json` to include your `FirebaseProjectId`
1. Update `Startup.cs` to handle JWTs
1. Update `Startup.cs` to call `UseAuthentication` before `UseAuthorization`
1. Copy in the `UserProfileRepository`, `IUserProfileRepository` and `UserProfileController` from Tabloid/Gifter and modify as needed
1. Register the `UserProfileRepository` with ASP.NET by calling `services.AddTransient` inside `Startup.cs`

> **NOTE:** Make sure to update the `namespace` of any classes you copy/paste from another project.

## Client Side

1. Create client directory and run `npx create-react-app .`
1. Setup proxy in `package.json`
1. Install firebase and react router using `npm install react-router-dom firebase`
1. Install whatever component library you want
1. Create a `.env.local` file in your `client` folder (DON'T forget the leading `.`) and add the firebase API Key
1. Update the `index.js` file to add the call to `firebase.initializeApp`
1. Copy in `UserProfileProvider.js`, `Login.js`, `Register.js` from Tabloid (and optionally copy in the `Login.css` file if you want that bootstrap styling)
1. Copy in `ApplicationViews.js` from Tabloid/Gifter and remove code that's not needed
1. Modify `App.js` to use the `Router`, `UserProfileProvider`, and `ApplicationViews` components
