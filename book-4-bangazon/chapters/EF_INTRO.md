# Object/Relational Mapping and Entity Framework

An Object/Relational Mapper (ORM) is a software tool for automatically connecting C# objects to relational database tables. You've likely noticed that when working with ADO<span>.NET</span> you have to write a lot of SQL and C# code that is largely repetitive. An ORM is a tool that does the repetitive SQL and boilerplate C# for you. An ORM greatly reduces - often eliminates - the need to write SQL in your application.

## Entity Framework

Entity Framework (EF) is a popular ORM created by Microsoft. It allows you to use LINQ methods in conjunction with your data models to interact with your database (e.g. SELECT. INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE data). EF then determines the SQL syntax needed to perform the appropriate action(s).

Here's an example showing the different between EF and ADO<span>.NET</span>. This example selects all of the departments from the Bangazon database.

## Select all Departments

### ADO<span>.NET</span> Example

```cs
public ActionResult Index()
{
    using (SqlConnection conn = Connection)
    {
        conn.Open();
        using (SqlCommand cmd = conn.CreateCommand())
        {
            cmd.CommandText = "SELECT Id, Name, Budget FROM Department";
            SqlDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader();

            List<Department> departments = new List<Department>();
            while (reader.Read())
            {
                departments.Add(new Department
                {
                    Id = reader.GetInt32(reader.GetOrdinal("Id")),
                    Name = reader.GetString(reader.GetOrdinal("name")),
                    Budget = reader.GetInt32(reader.GetOrdinal("budget"))
                });
            }
            reader.Close();
            return View(departments);
        }
    }
}

```

### EF Example

```cs
public async Task<IActionResult> Index()
{
    List<Department> departments = await _context.Department.ToListAsync();
    return View(departments);
}
```

## Create New Department

You also create new database entries with other methods that abstract the SQL away from you - the `Add()` and `SaveChangesAsync()` methods.

### ADO<span>.NET</span> Example

```cs
[HttpPost]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public ActionResult Create(Department department)
{
    using (SqlConnection conn = Connection)
    {
        conn.Open();
        using (SqlCommand cmd = conn.CreateCommand())
        {
            cmd.CommandText = @"INSERT INTO Department ([name], budget)
                                     VALUES (@name, @budget)";
            cmd.Parameters.Add(new SqlParameter("@name", department.Name));
            cmd.Parameters.Add(new SqlParameter("@budget", department.Budget));

            cmd.ExecuteReader();

            return RedirectToAction(nameof(Index));
        }
    }
}
```

### EF Example

```cs
[HttpPost]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public async Task<IActionResult> Create(Department department)
{
    if (ModelState.IsValid)
    {
        _context.Add(department);
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
        return RedirectToAction(nameof(Index));
    }
    return View(department);
}
```

### DbContext
In Entity Framework we don't directly use a `SqlConnection` object like we did in ADO.<span>NET</span>. Instead we use an instance of ` Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContext`.

In the examples above you'll notice the `_context` variable. This private field is the instance of our `DbContext` that we use in our controller to interact with the database.

The first step in creating a `DbContext` is to make a new class that inherits from it. This class is commonly called `ApplicationDbContext`. Because every database is different, Microsoft could not make a generic `DbContext` to cover everything. The `DbContext` EF provides is a base class that we extend with the specifics of our database.

Here is a partial implementation of an `ApplicationDbContext` for Bangazon's Workforce Application.

```cs
using Bangazon.Models;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace Bangazon.Data {
    public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext {
        public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options) : base(options) { }

        public DbSet<Employee> Employee { get; set; }
        public DbSet<Department> Department { get; set; }
    }
}
```
In order to get an instance of our `ApplicationDbContext` class in our controller, we use dependency injection. By creating a parameter in the controller's constructor, we're telling ASP.<span>NET</span> to give us an instance.

```cs
namespace Bangazon.Controllers {
    public class DepartmentsController : Controller {
        private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;

        public DepartmentsController(ApplicationDbContext context) {
            _context = context;
        }

        // ...controller actions that use the _context field...
    }
}
```

### DbSet&lt;T&gt;

Notice the `DbSet<T>` properties in `ApplicationDbContext`. `DbSet<T>`s are the link between models and database tables. The `ApplicationDbContext` above implies that we have `Employee` and `Department` model classes AND `Employee` and `Department` database tables.

Take another look at this line from the department query example above:

```cs
List<Department> departments = await _context.Department.ToListAsync();
```
We are accessing the `Department` property on the instance of our `ApplicationDbContext` in order to query the `Department` database table.

### CRUD with Entity Framework

#### Create

To insert a record into a database table use the context's `Add()` method followed by `SaveChangesAsync()`

```cs
Department dept = new Department() {
    Name = "Public Relations",
    Budget = 500_000
};
_context.Add(dept);
await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
```

> **NOTE:** the `Add` method only "stages" the insert action. The database is not updated until `SaveChangesAsync()` is called.

> **NOTE:** We do NOT set the department's `Id` property. The database will provide the new department id.

#### Read

To query a database table use LINQ queries on the appropriate `DbSet<T>`. In EF we have the full power of LINQ along with some additional capabilities that LINQ does not provide.

```cs
// Get all Employees
await _context.Employee.ToListAsync();

// Get an individual Employee by id
await _context.Employee.FindAsync(id);
// or
await _context.Employee.FirstOrDefaultAsync(e => e.id == id);

// Get all Employees with the last name of Garcia
// ordered by their first name
await _context.Employee
              .Where(e => e.LastName == 'Garcia')
              .OrderBy(e => e.FirstName)
              .ToListAsync();

// Get All supervisors and their departments
// "Include()" is the way to do simple SQL JOINS
await _context.Employee
              .Include(e => e.Department)
              .Where(e => e.IsSupervisor)
              .ToListAsync();
```

> **NOTE:** The query is not executed in the database until one of the "Async" methods is called. (e.g. `ToListAsync(), FindAsync(), FirstOrDefaultAsync()`)

#### Update

Update a record with the `Update()` method.

```cs
Employee emp = await _context.Employee.FirstOrDefaultAsync(e => e.FirstName == "Betty");

emp.FirstName = "Liz";

_context.Update(emp);
await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
```

#### Delete

Delete a record with the `Remove()` method.

```cs
Department dept = _context.Department.FindAsync(id);
_context.Remove(dept);
await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
```

### Startup.cs

To enable EF model-first migrations, this is what your `ConfigureServices` method should be in the `Startup.cs` file.

```cs
public void ConfigureServices (IServiceCollection services) {
    services.Configure<CookiePolicyOptions> (options => {
        // This lambda determines whether user consent for non-essential cookies is needed for a given request.
        options.CheckConsentNeeded = context => true;
        options.MinimumSameSitePolicy = SameSiteMode.None;
    });

    services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext> (options =>
        options.UseSqlServer (
            Configuration.GetConnectionString ("DefaultConnection")));

    services.AddMvc ().SetCompatibilityVersion (CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);
}
```

## The Cost of Convenience

While the simpler syntax may seem like a breath of fresh air, and much easier to read (_once you get used to it_), you pay for it with poorer performance. The SQL generated by EF is a sore spot by many developers because there are cases where it is not as fast and optimized as it would be if written out in long-form by the developer.
