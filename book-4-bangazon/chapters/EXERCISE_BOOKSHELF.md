# Exercise - BookShelf App

The purpose of this exercise is to practice creating a new MVC project using Entity and Identity Frameworks.

Your instruction team will demonstrate creating the initial structure of this application and then give you time to build it on your own.

> **NOTE:** It is **not** necessary to complete this exercise in order to learn from it.

## The BookShelf App

The goal of this application is to allow users to keep track of the books they have on their bookshelf, as well as the authors of those books.
