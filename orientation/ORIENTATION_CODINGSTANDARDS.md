#Bangazon Inc Coding Standards

###Bangazon Inc Developement Teams will Establish Common Standards for the Following Reasons:
Experienced developers follow numerous programming practices or rules of thumb, which typically derived from hard-learned lessons.
The practices listed below are not all-inclusive, and should not be used without due consideration.
Veteran programmers deviate from these practices on occasion, but not without careful consideration of the potential
repercussions. There will be times when members of development teams will move to a different development team or will 
need to work on code they are unfamilar with. 

Coding standards also make code review run more smoothly due to the fact that common techniques are used. 

A good source for examples of coding practices can be found here:
