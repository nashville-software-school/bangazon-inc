# The Family Dictionary

## Setup

```
mkdir -p ~/workspace/python/exercises/family_dictionary && cd $_
touch family_dict.py
```

## Instructions

1. Define a dictionary that contains information about several members of your family. Use the following example as a template.
    ```
    my_family = {
        'sister': {
            'name': 'Krista',
            'age': 42
        },
        'mother': {
            'name': 'Cathie',
            'age': 70
        }
    }
    ```
2. Using a dictionary comprehension, produce output that looks like the following example.
    ```
    Krista is my sister and is 42 years old
    ```

    > **Helpful hint:** To convert an integer into a string in Python, it's `str(integer_value)`
