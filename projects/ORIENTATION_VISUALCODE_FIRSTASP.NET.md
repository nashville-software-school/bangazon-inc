# Commonly Used Software Development Terms

##The following list contains commonly used terms use by many software development teams. 

1. Continous Integration-Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.

By integrating regularly, you can detect errors quickly, and locate them more easily. https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration

2. Source Control-A version control system (also known as a Revision Control System) is a repository of files, often the files for the source code of computer programs, with monitored access. Every change made to the source is tracked, along with who made the change, why they made it, and references to problems fixed, or enhancements introduced, by the change.

3. GitFlow-Vincent Driessen's branching model is a git branching and release management strategy that helps developers keep track of features, hotfixes and releases in bigger software projects.  http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/
